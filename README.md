<h1>Short about me 👇</h1>
<p>👋 Hi, I’m Cristine, a newbie in web development, learning JavaScript and React. </p>

<h1>The detailed version 👇</h1>

<p>
I'm a <b>classic good girl</b>, who has always been obsessed with school, learning, projects, creating beautiful and meaningful things, organization, technology, and languages. 

👩‍🏫 After high school, I thought the <b>teacher</b>'s roadmap was for me, so I went for it. I learned 6 years in Budapest to become a professional high school teacher, and when I started to work in Hungarian education, I realized I couldn't be further from myself. That profession was based on sticking with the old, rather than embracing the new, my colleagues hated technology developing around us, and all my creative efforts to implement modern approaches to children's education failed. During this time I was blogging about my views, and with that customized WordPress site, my interest turned towards web development in 2021. 

👩🏽‍💻In 2022 I returned to this magical place called Transylvania to pursue my <b>developer dreams </b> and get the best out of this digital freedom, that with my laptop I can work even from my granny's garden. I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the awesome free resources on the internet, and I created project after project. In 2023 I started learning ReactJS, which opened a whole new world with that rich ecosystem of libraries and technologies involved.
</p>

<h1>At this point 👇</h1>
<p>I'm working on a <b>PORTFOLIO</b> that contains:</p>
  <li> A <b>business website</b> designed for my wonderful hairdresser using only HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. Nothing special, just the basics, but it comes with three languages, and I got freedom in design and content</li>
  <li> A <b>blog application</b> that I would like to use later on to display my English and Hungarian writings. I'm planning to use Google's cloud for storing my images and Firebase for database and authentication. I'm building this in Next.Js using TypeScript and TailwindCSS for styling</li>
  <li> A web application for myself that functions as some kind of a <b>complex widget</b> that can be used in my browser during my working hours at home. It will utilize all the small apps that I'm building now: an analog clock, displaying the current date and counting down to the next big event, todos, notes, link collection, weather forecast in my area, maybe news, and background music with rain sounds. This could be a showcase of my JavaScript skills using different APIs and databases built in NextJS.</li>
  <li>A <b>headless Wordpress eCommerce website</b> for another good friend's handmade jewelry business in Hungary. I've already built a fully functioning WP webshop for her in 2022, but the customization was too costly for her needs, and as the WP CMR comes in handy, I decided to try a new approach with React. </li>
  <li>A small collection of <b>Javascript games </b> such as Snake, Space Invaders, Candy Crush, Pac-Man and a basic sidescroller. These might be fun to play for my 6-year-old, but it teaches me a lot about object-oriented programming.</li>
  <li>Displaying all these projects on a <b>3D personal portfolio webpage </b> that uses ThreeJS and a few other libraries. </li>

<h1>Why❓ 👇</h1>
<p>Because I would like to <b>get hired as a developer</b> as soon as possible so that my passion and evergrowing skillset could be utilized at a larger scale. I can't afford to spend another 6 years at the university to earn a master's in Computer Science, but I'm happily volunteering to learn anything as an intern that would add value to an existing project. Based on my portfolio I might look like someone with entrepreneurial ambitions, but actually, I'd love to be an employee, because I love working in a group, and <b>I'd rather build something really big with a team than small projects on my own </b>. I also think that both my communication skills and my teaching ambitions could prove handy later on at a growing company.</p>
