# Short about me ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristine, learning web development for about 2 years as a hobby. What I build at this point:


- simple websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- simple applications using React with Vite or CRA (todo app, weather app, etc.)
- more complex applications using Next.js (with different databases and API fetching)
