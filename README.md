# Short about me ðŸ‘‡

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cristine, learning web development. 
I'm coding every day because I truly ENJOY it and my goal is to turn my passion into a career.
#### What I can do at this point:

- create and manage **WordPress** websites (Elementor Containers and E-Commerce experience)
- build and deploy simple websites using **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
- develop simple applications using **React** with Vite or CRA (todo app, weather app, etc.)
- develop full-stack applications using **Next.js** (with database CRUD operations, API fetching)
- build simple databases in **MySQL**, **MongoDB** and **Firestore**
- build, test and deploy simple REST APIs with **Node.js** and **Express**
- write **documentation** for an application and use basic **GIT** commands
